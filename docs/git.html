<h2>GIT</h2>
			
			<p>Git is a versioning system.  <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is popular public site for hosting git repositories.  To add our code to a git repository we do the following one time:
				<pre>
git init
git add [FILES TO ADD TO GIT]
git remote add origin [REMOTE GITHUB REPO]
git commit
git push origin master					
				</pre>
				
				then when we are ready to edit and make changes and save them we use the following:
				
				<pre>
git commit [FILE THAT WAS CHANGED] -m "[MESSAGE]"
git push origin master 
				</pre>
				
				That will ensure that we have a stored copy of the previous versions of the files along with our new changes on GitHub and in our local GIT repos.<br /><br />
				
				If we want our repo to be used elsewhere, perhaps on our server, we do the following:
				
				<pre>
git clone [REMOTE GITHUB REPO]
				</pre>
				
				Any time we have new changes to we can pull them down with 
				
				<pre>
git pull origin master
				</pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>One handy feature of git is to have it ignore certain files and directories that you don't want included in a repo.  To use this, simply create and add a file called .gitignore to your repository and in the file list the files and directories you don't want included.  This is especially important when using node <a href="config.html">config</a> files.  Here is a sample .gitignore file:
			
			<pre>
.DS_Store
node_modules/
config.js
			</pre>
			
    </body>
